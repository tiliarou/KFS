# SunriseOS Architecture Documentation

SunriseOS is a reimplementation of the Horizon/NX kernel (which powers the Nintendo Switch) along with a custom userspace of our own design (but heavily inspired by the Horizon/NX userspace), written entirely in Rust with no dependencies on C/C++.

In the various modules, you'll find various documentations about the overall architecture, along with various development processes that are used.
