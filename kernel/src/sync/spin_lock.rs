/// This type provides mutual exclusion based on spinning.
/// It will panic if used in the context of an interrupt.
///
/// # Description
///
/// The behaviour of these locks is similar to `std::sync::Mutex`. they
/// differ on the following:
///
/// - The lock will not be poisoned in case of failure;
///
/// # Simple examples
///
/// ```
/// use crate::sync::SpinLock;
/// let spin_lock = SpinLock::new(0);
///
/// // Modify the data
/// {
///     let mut data = spin_lock.lock();
///     *data = 2;
/// }
///
/// // Read the data
/// let answer =
/// {
///     let data = spin_lock.lock();
///     *data
/// };
///
/// assert_eq!(answer, 2);
/// ```
///
/// # Thread-safety example
///
/// ```
/// use crate::sync::SpinLock;
/// use std::sync::{Arc, Barrier};
///
/// let numthreads = 1000;
/// let spin_lock = Arc::new(SpinLock::new(0));
///
/// // We use a barrier to ensure the readout happens after all writing
/// let barrier = Arc::new(Barrier::new(numthreads + 1));
///
/// for _ in (0..numthreads)
/// {
///     let my_barrier = barrier.clone();
///     let my_lock = spin_lock.clone();
///     std::thread::spawn(move||
///     {
///         let mut guard = my_lock.lock();
///         *guard += 1;
///
///         // Release the lock to prevent a deadlock
///         drop(guard);
///         my_barrier.wait();
///     });
/// }
///
/// barrier.wait();
///
/// let answer = { *spin_lock.lock() };
/// assert_eq!(answer, numthreads);
/// ```
