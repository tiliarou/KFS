//! Cross Process Mapping
//!
//! Provides mechanics for temporarily mirroring a Userland mapping in KernelLand.
//!
//! When kernel has to access memory in UserLand (for example a user has provided a buffer as an
//! argument of a syscall), it can do it in two ways:
//!
//! * Either the buffer is mapped in the same page tables that the kernel is currently using,
//!   in this case it accesses it directly, through a UserspacePtr.
//! * Either the buffer is only mapped in the page tables of another process, in which case
//!   it has to temporarily map it to KernelLand, make the modifications, and unmap it from KernelLand.
//!
//! This module covers the second case.
//!
//! The remapping is represented by a [`CrossProcessMapping`] structure. It is created from a reference
//! to the mapping being mirrored, and the KernelLand address where it will be remapped.
//! When this struct is dropped, the frames are unmap'd from KernelLand.
//!
//! A [`CrossProcessMapping`] shares the ownership of the underlying frames. As such, only refcounted
//! memory regions can be mirror-mapped. This is rarely a problem, as almost all memory is refcounted.
//!
//! There is no guarantee that the CrossProcessMapping doesn't outlive the original mapping.
//!
