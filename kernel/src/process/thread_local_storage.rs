//! TLS manager
//!
//! # Abstract
//!
//! For each thread of a process, the kernel allocates a 0x200-bytes "Thread Local Storage"
//! memory region in UserLand. In this region resides the 0x100-bytes IPC command buffer,
//! which is used by the user for passing IPC arguments, and a pointer to the user-controlled
//! "thread context", which will likely be used for holding userspace thread local variables.
//!
//! Each thread in a process has its own private TLS, and from userspace its address can be found out
//! at anytime by reading an architecture-specific register (aarch64 uses `tpidrro_el0`, x86 uses the
//! `gs` segment selector).
//!
//! # Location
//!
//! The TLS content is defined by the [TLS] structure. It is a 0x200-bytes memory area that leaves
//! in UserLand so it can be accessed and modified by the user.
//! The user is allowed to access and modify the TLS of other thread from its process if it
//! manages to find the location of their TLS, but this is not advised, as it serves little purpose.
//!
//! Kernel-side, each thread holds a raw pointer to its TLS (`*mut TLS`) in its [ThreadStruct].
//! This pointer is used by the kernel to get the thread's `ipc_command_buffer` address,
//! and is restored as part of hardware context on every context-switch.
//!
//! # Allocation
//!
//! Each process holds a [TLSManager] in its ProcessStruct, which manages the TLSs for this process,
//! keeps track of which ones are in-use and which ones are free, and try to re-use free TLSs when
//! spawning a thread.
//!
//! When a thread is being created, it asks its process's `TLSManager` via [allocate_tls] to get a pointer
//! to its TLS, and saves it in the `ThreadStruct`.
//!
//! When a thread dies, it notifies its process's `TLSManager` via [free_tls], so its TLS can be re-used.
//!
//! TLSs are only 0x200 bytes, so the `TLSManager` groups them together to fit inside a page,
//! and will allocate a new page every time it is full and cannot satisfy a TLS allocation.
//!
